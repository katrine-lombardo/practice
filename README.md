Welcome to my coding playground!

This repository is dedicated to my practice and learnings in various programming languages and learning topics, including database pipelines and ETLs. Each directory in this repository represents a separate programming language or learning topic, allowing me to organize my practice projects effectively.

Feel free to explore the different directories to see my progress and experiments in different areas. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting!
